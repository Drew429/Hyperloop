<div class="section" id="modeling-summary">
<h1>Modeling Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following sections outline the preliminary modeling work conducted by
our team. Our main focus was to produce a model that predicts the instantaneous
power required to run a transport capsule at the conditions specified in the
original work. These power requirements are a function of the capsule air
cycle and thermal conditions. The resultant power could then be combined
with the estimated travel time to size the battery and coolant storage
requirements. The following section provides a brief summary of the assumptions
and modeling that went into each sub-system necessary to perform this analysis.</p>
<p>For the sake of conciseness, each section serves as a general summary.
The reader is recommended to refer to the actual source code and
included documentation for full implementation details. The current
model omits economic, structural, safety, and infrastructure considerations;
areas that become more prominent once the core engineering concept is deemed
sufficiently feasible. These aspects are equally important to the overall
design and they represent the next required step in producing a viable hyperloop
design concept.</p>
<div class="section" id="tube-airflow-requirements">
<h2>Tube Airflow Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#tube-airflow-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The hyperloop pod travels through a fixed diameter tube. As it travels,
it must displace air around itself. The displaced air moves past the
pod with a relative velocity equal to the travel speed of the pod and
must fit into the area between the pod and the tube wall. If you assume
a circular cross section for the pod, then the area for the air to
travel through is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[A_{bypass} = \pi(r_{tube}^2-r_{pod}^2)\]</div>
<p>Given the conditions in the tube, we know the density of air to be
0.00118 <span class="math">\(\frac{kg}{m^3}\)</span>. The mass flow rate of the air
bypassing the pod is then given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\dot{W}_{bypass} = \rho_{air} A_{tube} V_{pod}\]</div>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(\rho_{air}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A_{tube}\)</span> are both constant for given tube size
and pressure, mass flow rate grows linearly with the velocity of the pod.</p>
<p>For any given flow there is a physical limitation to how the amount of
flow you can pass through a given area. The maximum flow rate occurs when
the velocity reaches Mach 1. For the hyperloop concept, all the air must fit
through the area between the pod and the tube, called <span class="math">\(A_{bypass}\)</span>. When
the air going through <span class="math">\(A_{bypass}\)</span> reaches Mach 1, no additional flow can pass through.
This is called the Kantrowitz limit.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\dot{W}_{kantrowitz} = \rho_{air} A_{bypass} V_{Mach 1}\]</div>
<p>If the required  <span class="math">\(\dot{W}_{kantrowitz}\)</span> exceeds the kantrowitz limit, then the pod will
act like a piston in a tube and start the increase the air pressure in front
of it and lower the pressure behind it. For the baseline hyperloop design,
the Kantrowitz limit speed is 120 <span class="math">\(\frac{m}{s}\)</span>, or Mach .35, as shown in the
figure below. The limit is reached when the required tube mass flow equals
the kantrowitz limit flow.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="kantrowitz limit for hyperloop" src="_images/kantrowitz_limit.png" />
<p class="caption">The Kantrowitz limit for the baseline hyperloop concept</p>
</div>
<p>Such low speeds would not allow the hyperloop concept to significantly reduce
travel times between Los Angeles and San Francisco. To reach higher speeds,
a compression system is needed to help push additional air around the pod
to enable higher travel speeds. The amount of air that the compression system needs
to move is equal to the difference between the required tube flow (the blue line)
and the Kantrowitz limit (the green line). As speed increases, the flow demands on the
compression system increase as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compression-system">
<h2>Compression System<a class="headerlink" href="#compression-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The compression system performs two functions on the hyperloop concept.</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>Pressurizes some of the air, increasing its density, to provide a means of exceeding
the Kantrowitz limit.</li>
<li>Provides a source of high pressure air to the air bearing system.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each of these functions requires that the compressors move a certain amount of air, which
combine to define the total airflow for the whole sub-system. The system is comprised of
an inlet, two compressors, two heat exchangers, a nozzle, and a duct to air bearings.</p>

<p>The compression systems is modeled as a 1-D cycle, representing components as a
thermodynamic processes which are chained together. These models predict the instantaneous
power consumption of the compression system for a given set of design variable values. The
compression system is defined by 8 design variables, shown below.</p>

<h2>Tube Temperature<a class="headerlink" href="#tube-temperature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As each pod passes through the tube, it adds energy to the air in an amount equivalent to what was
used to power the compressors. This added energy will cause a small temperature rise in the pod. Each
pod cause an additional slight temperature rise as it passes, which could potentially heat the overall
hyperloop system to excessive temperatures. In the original proposal, to combat this effect, it was
proposed that water-to-air heat exchangers could be added to the compression system. These would use
water stored in tanks in the pod to cool the air by converting it to steam. The steam could then be
stored in an additional tank, and offloaded once the pod reached its destination. According to our
initial calculations, using water for cooling is not an ideal design for two reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1) The flow rate of water needed to remove the heat added by the compressors is very large, and
storing the resulting steam would result in an unreasonably large pod (over 200 meters long).</p>
<p>2) The heat addition from each pod moving through the tube is fairly low, even when compared to
radiative solar heating of the steel tube. Even with no active cooling solution, the tube temperatures
won’t reach excessive levels.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the following two sections, we explain the analyses we used to draw the above conclusions.</p>
<div class="section" id="water-steam-storage-requirements">
<h3>Water/Steam Storage Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#water-steam-storage-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A baseline heat exchanger model was developed to investigate the weight and sizing requirements of an
on-board water cooling system using the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) method. The
exchanger was sized to remove all excess heat generated by the two compressors using a pedagogical shell
and tube design. Based on the temperature restraints and exhaust flow rate determined by the cycle model,
necessary water flow rates were calculated to ensure an energy balance. Given a predefined heat exchanger
cross-section, fluid flow regimes and heat transfer coefficients were obtained. The combination of all of
these elements provide a first-cut approximation of tank sizes, total heat exchanger volume, and pumping
requirements.</p>

<h3>Equilibrium Tube Temperature<a class="headerlink" href="#equilibrium-tube-temperature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A high-level assessment of the overall steady-state heat transfer between the 300 mile hyperloop tube and
the ambient atmosphere was also investigated. The outer diameter of the pipe was chosen as the control
surface boundary. Heat added from the capsule exhaust air and solar flux were considered the primary drivers
for heat absorption into the tube. Heat released from the tube was modeled by means of ambient natural
convection, and radiation out from the stainless-steel surface. The thermal interaction between the rarified
internal air and tube was not modeled and assumed to reach steady-state in a reasonable period of time. These
calculations served to approximate the necessary cooling requirements of the on-board heat exchanger given a
certain steady-state heat limit within the tube.</p>

<h1>Future Modeling RoadMap<a class="headerlink" href="#future-modeling-roadmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The current model of the hyperloop focuses on some of the primary sub-systems that operate within the pod.
However, there is much more analysis that needs to be done to build a complete hyperloop design. Below provides
a brief summary of the areas we feel represent the logical next steps for the modeling process.</p>
<div class="section" id="system-design-optimization">
<h2>System Design Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#system-design-optimization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The current baseline appears to be a feasible design, but the design space is large (and will grow with additional
models) and needs to be more fully explored. Overall, the goal of the hyperloop design should be to find the right
compromise between maximum passenger throughput, minimum travel time, and minimum cost per trip. The following are
some major open questions about the hyperloop design space:</p>
<p>1) What is the relationship between overall energy usage and tube pressure? Would a slightly higher pressure lower
the overall energy consumption by reducing vacuum pump effort more than it increases power requirements for the pod?</p>
<p>2) What is the best combination of pressure ratios for the compression system? Does the bypass air need to be
pressurized so highly?</p>
<p>3) What is the best size for the tube diameter? Larger diameters will increase pump effort, but decrease pod power
usage? Could a larger diameter coupled with a slightly higher pressure provide superior performance?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="battery-and-motors">
<h2>Battery and Motors<a class="headerlink" href="#battery-and-motors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The initial estimates of battery size and weight rely on extremely simple calculations. As noted, the power requirements
amount to roughly three batteries from a Tesla Model-S. Much better weight and size estimates for these off-the-shelf
batteries need to be integrated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="air-bearings">
<h2>Air Bearings<a class="headerlink" href="#air-bearings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The current models assume a fixed mass flow requirement for the air bearing system. A more accurate model would account
for the overall weight of the pod, the pressure of the air, and the overall bearing size. A more detailed bearing model
should be coupled to the compression system model to ensure a feasible design is achieved.</p>

<h2>Solar Power Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#solar-power-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the major features of the hyperloop concept is its near net-zero energy consumption, via the inclusion of solar panels
along the length of the tubes. Models are needed to predict, based on geographical location, weather, and time of year, how
much power could be produced on an ongoing basis from such a solar panel system.</p>
