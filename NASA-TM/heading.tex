\abstract{The hyperloop concept is a proposed transportation system aimed to lower costs and travel times relative to California's current high speed rail project. \cite{Musk} The design consists of a passenger pod traveling in a tube under light vacuum at ground level and near sonic speeds. Even with the tube mostly evacuated, the speed of the capsule is limited by the ability of air to escape around the sides of the vehicle determined by the relative diameters of the capsule and the tube. The capsule carries a compression system that provides pressurized air to the air bearings and helps to bypass some of the air through the capsule itself. This compression system introduces size constraints on the capsule itself. This situation introduces a coupling between the speed the capsule travels and the required size of the tube it travels in. This work investigates that coupling in order to size the capsule and tube for a given maximum speed. The results indicate that travel speeds 
around Mach .85 are reachable with reasonable tube sizes. In addition, some basic sizing estimates are made to quantify the effect on maximum 
speed on overall travel time and required battery sizes on the capsule.  }   % suggested 200 words (currently 160 words)
