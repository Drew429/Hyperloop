\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Hyperloop is a new mode of transportation proposed as an alternative to California's high speed rail project,
with the intended benefits of higher performance at lower overall costs.
It consists of a passenger pod traveling through a tube under a light vacuum and suspended on air bearings.
The pod would travel at transonic speeds resulting in a 30 minute travel time between the proposed route from Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Of the two variants outlined, the smaller system would consist of a 1.1 meter tall passenger capsule traveling through a 2.2 meter tube at 700 miles per hour.
The passenger pod features water-based heat exchangers as well as an on-board compression system that reduces the aerodynamic drag as it moves through the tube.
Although the initial analysis looks very promising,
it assumes that tube and pod dimensions are independently sizable without acknowledging the constraints of the compressor system on the pod geometry.
This work focuses on the aerodynamics and thermodynamic interactions between the two largest systems; the tube and the pod.
A new sizing method is developed for Hyperloop based on one-dimensional thermodynamic relationships that accounts for the strong interactions between these sub-systems.
These additional considerations require a tube nearly twice the size originally considered and limit the maximum pod travel speed to about 620 miles per hour.
Although the results indicate that hyperloop will need to be larger and slightly slower than originally intended,
the estimated travel time only increases by approximately five minutes, so the overall performance is not dramatically affected.
In addition, an on-board heat exchanger system is not necessary to achieve reasonable equilibrium air temperatures in the tube.
Removal of this subsystem represents a potential reduction in weight, energy requirements and complexity of the pod.
The concept still appears viable and very attractive, although additional engineering and economic analyses are still needed before a more complete design can be developed.
