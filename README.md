# Hyperloop Model


This is an open-source system model of the Hyperloop transportation 
system outlined in Elon Muskâ€™s proposal. It's primary 
purpose is to provide a completely open-source multidisciplinary model 
as a central point for continued crowd-sourced refinement of the concept. 
The current model focusses mainly on the compression system: inlet compressors, 
heat exchangers, ducting, and nozzle. The entire model is a work in progress 
and was built with the hope that external participation can help both 
refine our estimates and expand the model to include other important 
aspects of the hyperloop concept.

Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the problem, an overarching framework is 
needed to orchestrate the interaction between models of the various subsystems. So 
the entire model is built ontop of the OpenMDAO framework. 
OpenMDAO is an open source effort, out of the NASA Glenn Research Center,  
that suits the needs of this problem well. It provides advanced modeling and optimization 
capabilities and provides a flexible structure to grow and refine the hyperloop models. 
OpenMDAO includes a plugin system, which we used to build this model. The entire thing is built 
and distributed as an OpenMDAO plugin, To further improve the ability for others to expand and improve on this work. 


## Pre-Reqs


### OpenMDAO
There are two ways to use this plugin, but both assume you have already installed OpenMDAO. 
If you need to install OpenMDAO follow the [install instructions](http://openmdao.org/docs/getting-started/index.html). 

If you're using a Mac, then you're best bet for installing all the pre-requisites is to use 
homebrew. You can follow these [detailed instructions](http://www.lowindata.com/2013/installing-scientific-python-on-mac-os-x/)
but once you have homebrew installed and setup, here is the short version: 

```
brew install git
brew install python
brew install gfortran
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
brew install freetype
pip install matplotlib
```

### PyCycle
The hyperloop model depends on another plugin, [PyCycle](https://github.com/OpenMDAO-Plugins/pyCycle).
You should follow the installation instruction for that plugin first.  


## Installation
Then, make sure you have activated your OpenMDAO environemnt. Now you should clone this repository to your 
local machine. Alternately, you can fork this repo and then clone your fork. Either way. 

    git clone https://github.com/OpenMDAO-Plugins/Hyperloop.git

Next navigate to the top level of the repo and issue the following command 

    python setup.py develop

This will install plugin and let you make modifications as you like. 

## Please Read The Docs

    plugin docs hyperloop

The docs give a lot of background on the model, and explain the thinking that went into its 
structure. They also give some usage examples. 

### Quickstart
If you just can't want to get started, then here you go: 

    cd src/hyperloop
    python hyperloop_sim.py
